Create a photorealistic image of a contemporary art sculpture displayed in a modern white art gallery. The sculpture is placed on a square white pedestal and enclosed inside a transparent glass display case.
The artwork resembles a large dragon fruit (pitaya) that has been cut open. One half stands upright vertically, split lengthwise, revealing an unexpected interior: instead of the typical seeded flesh, the inside contains multiple small, smooth, bird-like forms tightly packed together. These forms are soft yellow in colour with subtle brown accents, giving a surreal and organic appearance. The outer skin of the dragon fruit should have a natural texture, slightly thick and curved, while the inside appears sculpted and polished.
The second half of the dragon fruit lies horizontally beside it on the pedestal, slightly curved and hollow. The gallery lighting is soft and overhead, casting gentle shadows and creating faint reflections on the glass enclosure. In the background, include minimal white walls with subtle framed artworks and a circular sculpture mounted on the wall. The overall mood should feel minimalist, contemporary, and slightly surreal, like a high-resolution photograph taken inside a professional art museum.
