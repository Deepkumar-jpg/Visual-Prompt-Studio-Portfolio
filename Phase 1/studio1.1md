prompt:Create a large-scale mural (medium) in a representational style located on the exterior wall of a public library in downtown Dallas. The subject matter should depict a diverse group of students breaking chains made of books labelled “Censorship” and “Inequality.” The mural should reflect on the social issue of restricted access to education and information.
The meaning of the artwork should symbolise the power of knowledge as liberation. The social role of the mural is to inspire discussion about educational inequality and act as a peaceful protest against censorship policies. Use bold colours, strong contrast, and expressive facial expressions to evoke urgency and hope.
